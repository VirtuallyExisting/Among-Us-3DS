# How to compile Among Us Cross (ALL platforms)

There is a list of things you'll have to do to compile AU3DS/AUCross:

1. Install the right dependencies:
   devkitPro (with proper tools selected for which version you're compiling)
   
   vcplib (Look at my account or just search it up here on github)
   
   (Wii) GRRLIB
   
   No additional tools are required besides the ones that come with devkitPro after you install vcplib (install GRRLIB if on Wii)
   
3. Download the source code for the version you want to compile
4. Go to that folder and open a terminal there, type in "make" then hit enter, it should compile.
5. Grab the file you got:

   (Wii) .dol
   
   (3DS) .3dsx
   
   (DS) .nds
   
7. Put that file onto your console (there are various ways across consoles, I'm not gonna get into that though.)

You have officially compiled Among Us Cross!

# Can I use your code, or at least, base my code off of yours?
Yes. I am a pretty bad programmer, but if you want to use my code, you are welcome, I do not own the Among Us franchise, nor do I claim the rights to the audio, graphics, or mechanics.
