# Among Us 3DS
A recreation of Among Us with new features and completely rewritten for the Nintendo 3DS


### This is an Early Alpha
This is not complete in the slightest. Check back later for more updates!

## THIS PROJECT IS NOT COMPLETE!
It has many bugs and quirks that need to be worked out, but I am commited to completing this remake.


# Why did you make this?
Among Us is a very unique game, making use of multiplayer in very interesting ways, but, one day, I thought, I'm a crappy programmer and I haven't programmed in C in my entire life, why not make a remake of Among Us for my faithful 3DS in one of the hardest programming languages?

# How did you make this?
I copied a lot of code from examples mainly, but I will use the UDS functions from devkitPro for local multiplayer (which I find REALLY cool.) And I also used citro2d to render things on screen, and for other things, it was just trial and error with variables and math functions, otherwise known as torment.

# How can I help this project?
I don't take donations, but I would like it if you contributed useful information in the issues tab, I would like help or at least documentation with local multiplayer, and you can feel free to create a pull request if you'd like to contribute a feature to this remake.
